# Tahoe-streamflow-and-nearshore-metabolism
This repository is to help users replicate figures and analysis associated with the publication "The influence of mountain streamflow on nearshore metabolism in a large, oligotrophic lake across drought and wet years" 

## Reccomended steps
This project brough in a variety of spatiotemporl data for different sites within nested shore locations across Lake Tahoe so please contact me kellyloria [at] gmail.com for specific question or data additonal data products.
